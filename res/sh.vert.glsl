/* this vertex shader takes in unsigned integers formatted as (x,y,w,h), which denote rectangles
 * the shader is responsible to output the data for this rectangle in the same format,
 * but transformed to match the OpenGL coördinate space.
 * I found the formula `(x-0.5*l)/0.5*l` to work well for scaling an axis to fit within the -1—1 coördinate space.
 * And for transforming width/height, you just divide by the length of the corresponding axis.
 * I demonstrate this here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ptwuyiv6bh */
